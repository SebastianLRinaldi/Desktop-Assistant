# Desktop-Assistant

We do we want to add? 

I want to be able to lanch youtube downloader 
I want to be able to test youtube downloader
I want text-to-speech
I want uncensored language model 
I want free image generation 
I want desktop commands
    - things like show all processs
    - show largest process

I want to open youtube 
I want to open speicifc tabs in seperate or same window for different task
    - EX: user: Japanese --> would open up miro and duolingo
    - EX: user: drawing --> would open up pintrest on drawing references and overlay program
          -  at certain times of day these could open as well (habit building) - if I haven't openned them during the day?

- I would like to try and get is some personailty in the language model so that it can send me notifications during the day
- Would have the virutal interface as well with the transparent window 
    - would try and get that vistural interface to be like what brenenene showed me with the steam app

- Some how get it to do my note parsing 
    - tell it where curser with speech to text
    - edit specific lines with speech to text
    - like a "select line 50"
    - certain things I could say are scroll up, scroll down for the window
    - I could also attch the language model to it so that it could have commands like summarize
        - this would summarize the note and place that text at the top or bottom?  

- need to also somehow run command in the background?
    - so that I can do one thing like download, but also 
        have the bot search the internet, then tell me when 
        something is done and show the next prompt  
    - need to also have like multipel screens with like mini terminals 
        for each command to prompt to 
    - but the main window only shows like enter another prompt 
        or when a process was finished

Act as two chatbots, one chatbot will do a highlevel implementation and the other will  have a better alterantive (or help me brain storm implementations for this idea)

for highlevel implementation respond with 'chatbot1':

for critque respond with 'chatbot2':

the project is being built by a solo dev, one user,  on a local machine, I would like it to be in python.

iterate the converstaion for 10 cycles
